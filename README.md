This web app is not 100% done yet ðŸ˜„. I've struggled with time and some unfamiliar things but hope to get it done soon. This is my first time using Redux toolKit, and it has been an amazing experience to deal with in this short amount of time. I know it's not perfect, but I've put in extraordinary effort with it. âœ¨
